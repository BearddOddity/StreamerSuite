Managing Event Subscriptions
Twitch provides a number of events that you can subscribe to to get near real time notifications. For a list of events, see
EventSub Subscription Types
.
Before subscribing to events, make sure your event handler is ready to receive notifications; otherwise, your subscription request will fail. For information about writing a webhook event handler, see
Getting Events Using Webhooks
and for information about writing a WebSocket event handler, see
Getting Events Using WebSockets
.
Subscribing to events
To subscribe to events, use the
Create EventSub Subscription
endpoint. The object in the request’s body must include:
The
type
field, which identifies the event you’re subscribing to. For example, to get notifications when a broadcaster gets a new follower, you’d set the
type
field to
channel.follow
. For information about handling subscription types that specify scopes, see
Authorization
.
The
version
field, which identifies the definition of the subscription type to use. For example, to use the first definition that Twitch defined for
channel.follow
, you’d set the
version
field to
1
.
The
condition
field, which identifies the parameters under which the event fires. For example, if you’re requesting notifications when a broadcaster gets a new follower, you’d set the condition object’s
broadcaster_user_id
field to the broadcaster’s ID.
The
transport
field, which tells Twitch the transport method you’re using to receive notifications. Set the transport object’s
method
field to
webhook
or
websocket
.
If you’re using webhooks, use the
callback
field to specify your event handler’s URI and use the
secret
field to specify the hash used to verify the event’s data. The URI must use SSL on port 443. For information about the secret, see
Verifying the event message
.
If you’re using WebSockets, set the
session_id
field to the ID that the
Welcome message
returns.
The following example shows how to create a subscription using the webhooks transport.
curl
-X
POST
'https://api.twitch.tv/helix/eventsub/subscriptions'
\
-H
'Authorization: Bearer 2gbdx6oar67tqtcmt49t3wpcgycthx'
\
-H
'Client-Id: wbmytr93xzw8zbg0p1izqyzzc5mbiz'
\
-H
'Content-Type: application/json'
\
-d
'{"type":"channel.follow","version":"2","condition":{"broadcaster_user_id":"1234", "moderator_user_id": "1234"},"transport":{"method":"webhook","callback":"https://example.com/callback","secret":"s3cre77890ab"}}'
If the request succeeds, it returns HTTP status code 202 and the response’s body contains a JSON object that echoes your request. For webhooks, the
status
field indicates the state of your subscription. The status is set to
webhook_callback_verification_pending
while Twitch attempts to verify that you own the event handler specified in the
callback
field; Twitch won’t send you events until it verifies the callback. After Twitch verifies your callback, the subscription’s status changes to
enabled
, which indicates that your subscription is active and able to receive events. For WebSockets, the
status
field is set to
enabled
.
The following example shows the response for the above webhooks request.

The request may fail in some cases, including:
Incorrect or missing fields
Access tokens were used that are invalid, expired, of the incorrect type, or are lacking the required scopes
A subscription already exists for the specified event type and
condition
combination
The HTTP response code will have more information about the exact reason for your failure. For more information, see
Create EventSub Subscription
.
Authorization
When subscribing to events using WebSockets, you must use a user access token only. The request fails if you use an app access token. The
Subscription Types
topic lists the scope requirement for each event. If the event doesn’t specify a scope requirement, you must create a user access token with no scope.
When subscribing to events using webhooks, you must use an app access token. The request fails if you use a user access token. For subscription types that require user authorization, the user must grant your app (client ID) permissions to the required scopes prior to subscribing to the event.
For example, to subscribe to
channel.subscribe
events, the broadcaster must grant your app permission to get users that subscribe to them. This adds the
channel:read:subscriptions
scope to your app’s client ID. This means that prior to sending a subscription request, your app must get a user access token with the required scope, and then get an app access token using the same client ID, which you use to subscribe to the events. If your client ID doesn’t include the scope, the subscription request fails.
Getting the list of events you subscribe to
To get the list of events that you subscribe to, use the
Get EventSub Subscriptions
endpoint.
If you specified the webhook transport when you subscribed to events, use an app access token, but if you used the WebSocket transport, use a user acccess token (no scope requirements).
The following request shows how to get the first page of events that you subscribe to.
curl
-X
GET
'https://api.twitch.tv/helix/eventsub/subscriptions'
\
-H
'Authorization: Bearer 2gbdx6oar67tqtcmt49t3wpcgycthx'
\
-H
'Client-Id: wbmytr93xzw8zbg0p1izqyzzc5mbiz'
The response contains a JSON object for each event you subscribe to. The list is
paginated
and is in ascending order by creation date (oldest subscription first).

}
Because it can take a few seconds for the
total
field to update after subscriptions are added or deleted, you should consider the value an approximation.
For information about the
cost
,
total_cost
, and
max_total_cost
fields, see
Subscription limits
.
If you’re using WebSockets and the WebSocket is disconnected, the
Subscription
object includes the
disconnected_at
field, which lets you know when the connection was lost.
NOTE
The GET API returns disabled WebSocket subscriptions for a minimum of 1 minute as compared to webhooks which returns disabled subscriptions for a minimum of 10 days.
Filtering the list by type
You can filter the list of subscriptions by the event’s type and status. The filters are mutually exclusive (you cannot specify both
type
and
status
in the same request).
To filter the list by type, set the
type
query parameter to a subscription type. The following example filters the list for all
channel.follow
subscriptions.
curl
-X
GET
'https://api.twitch.tv/helix/eventsub/subscriptions?type=channel.follow'
\
-H
'Authorization: Bearer 2gbdx6oar67tqtcmt49t3wpcgycthx'
\
-H
'Client-Id: wbmytr93xzw8zbg0p1izqyzzc5mbiz'
Filtering the list by status
To filter the list by the subscription’s status, set the
status
query parameter to one of the following values:
enabled
— Twitch has verified your callback and is able to send you notifications.
webhook_callback_verification_pending
— Twitch is verifying that you own the callback specified in the create subscription request. For information about how it does this, see
Verifying your callback
. Used only for webhook subscriptions.
webhook_callback_verification_failed
— Twitch failed to verify that you own the callback specified in the create subscription request. Fix your event handler to correctly respond to the challenge, and then try subscribing again. Used only for webhook subscriptions.
notification_failures_exceeded
— Twitch revoked your subscription because the notification delivery failure rate was too high. Used only for webhook subscriptions.
authorization_revoked
— Twitch revoked your subscription because the users in the
condition
object revoked their authorization letting you get events on their behalf, or changed their password.
moderator_removed
— The moderator that authorized the subscription is no longer one of the broadcaster’s moderators.
user_removed
— Twitch revoked your subscription because the users in the
condition
object are no longer Twitch users.
version_removed
— Twitch revoked your subscription because the subscription to subscription type and version is no longer supported.
beta_maintenance
— Twitch revoked your subscription because the beta subscription type was undergoing maintenance.
websocket_disconnected
— The client closed the connection.
websocket_failed_ping_pong
— The client failed to respond to a ping message.
websocket_received_inbound_traffic
— The client sent a non-pong message. Clients may only send pong messages (and only in response to a ping message).
websocket_connection_unused
— The client failed to subscribe to events within the required time.
websocket_internal_error
— The Twitch WebSocket server experienced an unexpected error.
websocket_network_timeout
— The Twitch WebSocket server timed out writing the message to the client.
websocket_network_error
— The Twitch WebSocket server experienced a network error writing the message to the client.
The following example filters the list for all enabled subscriptions.
curl
-X
GET
'https://api.twitch.tv/helix/eventsub/subscriptions?status=enabled'
\
-H
'Authorization: Bearer 2gbdx6oar67tqtcmt49t3wpcgycthx'
\
-H
'Client-Id: wbmytr93xzw8zbg0p1izqyzzc5mbiz'
Deleting a subscription
To delete a subscription, use the
Delete EventSub Subscription
endpoint. Set the
id
query parameter to the subscription to delete.
NOTE
It’s important to first delete all subscriptions before deleting an application. Otherwise, subscriptions will still be sent to the registered callbacks from when the subscriptions were created.
If you specified the webhook transport when you subscribed to events, use an app access token, but if you used the WebSocket transport, use a user acccess token (no scope requirements).
curl
-X
DELETE
'https://api.twitch.tv/helix/eventsub/subscriptions?id=f1c2a387-161a-49f9-a165-0f21d7a4e1c4'
\
-H
'Authorization: Bearer 2gbdx6oar67tqtcmt49t3wpcgycthx'
\
-H
'Client-Id: wbmytr93xzw8zbg0p1izqyzzc5mbiz'
Subscription limits
EventSub uses a cost-based system for subscription limits. Subscription responses include the following fields to help you keep track of your subscription limits:
cost
— How much the subscription counts against your application’s limit.
total_cost
— The current sum of all your subscription costs.
max_total_cost
— Your application’s subscription limit.
The maximum number of subscriptions you can create grows as users authorize your application. Here’s how it works:
There is a limit of 3 subscriptions with the same
type
and
condition
values.
There is no cost for subscriptions that require a user to authorize your application (e.g.,
channel.subscribe
).
There is a cost for subscriptions that require you to specify a user but does not require that user to authorize your application (e.g.,
stream.online
,
channel.update
). However, there is no cost if that user has authorized your application (i.e., you have an OAuth scope for that user).
Example
Suppose you want to create three subscriptions:
stream.online
(no auth requirements, cost 1)
channel.update
(no auth requirements, cost 1)
channel.cheer
(
bits:read
OAuth scope required, cost 0)
User A has granted
bits:read
authorization to your application. Because the user has authorized your application, the total cost of these three subscriptions is 0.
User B has granted
channel:moderate
authorization to your application. The cost of subscribing to
stream.online
and
channel.update
subscriptions is 0. Your application cannot create a
channel.cheer
subscription because User B has not authorized your application with the required OAuth scope.
User C has not granted authorization to your application. The cost of subscribing to
stream.online
and
channel.update
subscriptions is 2. Your application cannot create a
channel.cheer
subscription because User C has not authorized your application with the required OAuth scope.
WebSocket limits
The following limits apply per user token (client ID and user ID tuple).
You may create a maximum of 3 WebSockets connections with enabled subscriptions.
Reconnecting using a reconnection URL (see
Reconnect message
) doesn’t add to your WebSocket count.
Each WebSocket connection may create a maximum of 300 enabled subscriptions (disabled subscriptions don’t count against the limit).
The
max_total_cost
is 10 across all subscriptions.
