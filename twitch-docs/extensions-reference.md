Extensions Reference
Reviews for chatbot verification continue to be temporarily paused while we revise our processes. Reviews for Extensions, developer organizations, and game ownership have resumed. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
As of July 9th 2024, there is no longer a requirement to have an Apple Developer account, or fill out the "iOS Allowlist Request" form, to allow an Extension to work on the iOS version of the Twitch app. All mobile Extensions, existing and new, are available on iOS and Android without additional requirements in the submission process.
This reference covers the
JavaScript helper
,
client query parameters
, and the
JWT schema
. For Twitch API endpoints related to Extensions, refer to the
Twitch API reference
.
JavaScript Helper
Namespace
See …
window.Twitch.ext

window.Twitch.ext.features
Helper: Feature Flags
window.Twitch.ext.bits
Helper: Bits
Helper: Extensions
The Extensions JavaScript helper uses these strings:
version
— This encodes the Helper version in 1.1.1 (
semantic versioning
) format.
environment
— This encodes the environment. For external users, this is always
production
.
onAuthorized
window.Twitch.ext.onAuthorized: function(authCallback: Function)
This callback is fired each time the JWT is refreshed.
authCallback
is a function with one argument, an object with these properties:
Property
Type
Description
channelId
string
Channel ID of the page where the extension is iframe embedded.
clientId
string
Client ID of the extension.
token
JWT
JWT that should be passed to any EBS call for authentication.
helixToken
JWT
JWT that can be used for front end API requests. See
Using the Twitch API in an Extension Front End
.
userId
string
Opaque user ID.
For example:
window
.
Twitch
.
ext
.
onAuthorized
(
function
(
auth
)
{
console
.
log
(
'The JWT that will be passed to the EBS is'
,
auth
.
token
);
console
.
log
(
'The channel ID is'
,
auth
.
channelId
);
});
Usually, the JWT obtained from this call is passed as a header during AJAX calls to the EBS. For example:
window
.
Twitch
.
ext
.
onAuthorized
(
function
(
auth
)
{
fetch
(
'/<some backend path>'
,
{
method
:
'GET'
,
headers
:{
'x-extension-jwt'
:
auth
.
token
,
},
})
.
then
(...);
});

onError
window.Twitch.ext.onError: function(errorCallback: Function)
This callback is fired if any errors are generated by the extension helper.
errorCallback
is a function with one argument, the error value, when any errors occur within the helper.
onHighlightChanged
window.Twitch.ext.onHighlightChanged: void function(callback: Function)
This function allows an extension to adjust its visibility when the viewer highlights the extension by hovering over the extension’s menu icon or open menu, in the video player. The function applies only to video-overlay and component Extensions.
Argument
Type
Description
callback
function
A callback that is called with one argument:
isHighlighted — A boolean indicating whether the extension is highlighted by the user.
onVisibilityChanged
window.Twitch.ext.onVisibilityChanged: void function(callback: Function)
This function registers a callback that gets called whenever an extension is hidden/re-shown, either due to the viewer’s action or due to extensions hiding due to the video player changing to a state where extensions are not shown (such as when the video pauses or an ad is running). When an extension is not visible, it does not receive
onContext
updates and must perform only minimal work in the background.
Argument
Type
Description
callback
function
A callback that is called with one or two arguments:
isVisible — A boolean indicating whether the extension is visible.
context — A fresh context object like the one passed by onContext. context is present only when isVisible is true.
send
window.Twitch.ext.send: function(target: String, contentType: String, message: Object)
window.Twitch.ext.send: function(target: String, contentType: String, message: String)
This function can be called by the front end to send directly to PubSub. It uses the Twitch-provided JWT for broadcasters, to allow broadcasters to send a broadcast (channel) or whisper message. Broadcasters cannot send to global.
Argument
Type
Description
target
string
Target topic. Usually this is
"broadcast"
(but it could be
"whisper-<userId>"
).
contentType
string
Content type of the serialized message; for example,
"application/json"
.
message
object or string
Either an object that will be automatically serialized as JSON or a string.
listen
window.Twitch.ext.listen: void function(target: String, callback: Function)
This function binds the
callback
to listen to the
target
topic.
Argument
Type
Description
target
string
Target topic. Usually this is
"broadcast"
or
"global"
(but it could be
"whisper-<userId>"
).
If an extension front end listens to
"broadcast"
on a channel, it will receive messages sent to the channel, for that extension/channel combination. If it listens to
"global"
, it will see messages sent to global, for all channels with that extension installed.
Non-Extensions PubSub topics also are supported.
callback
function
Function with three arguments:
target
,
contentType
, and
message
. These fields correspond to the values in the
send
message, except the message is always a string.
Whispers are a set of optional PubSub channels that extensions can use. Each copy of an extension can register for
"whisper-<userId>"
where
userId
comes from the
onAuthorized
message. Attempts to listen to another userId will be blocked. Once the extension is listening, the EBS or broadcaster can send an individualized message to the channel.
unlisten
window.Twitch.ext.unlisten: void function(target: String, callback: Function)
This function unbinds the listen
callback
from the
target
.
Argument
Type
Description
target
string
Target topic. Often this is
"broadcast"
but it might be
"whisper-<userId>"
.
Non-Extensions PubSub topics also are supported.
callback
function
Function with three arguments:
target
,
contentType
, and
message
. These fields correspond to the values in the
send
message, except the message is always a string.
This must be the original function object: passing in a new function or a copy of the original has no effect.
Helper: Actions
followChannel
window.Twitch.ext.actions.followChannel: void function(channelName: String)
This function prompts users to follow the specified channel, with a dialog controlled by Twitch. When users confirm (through the dialog) that they want to follow the channel, the callback registered with
Twitch.ext.actions.onFollow
is invoked.
Argument
Type
Description
channelName
string
Channel to be followed.
minimize
window.Twitch.ext.actions.minimize: function()
This function causes your video-component or video-overlay extension to be minimized.
onFollow
window.Twitch.ext.actions.onFollow: void function(callback: Function)
This function registers a callback that is invoked whenever a user completes an interaction prompted by the
followChannel
action.
Argument
Type
Description
callback
function
Function with two arguments:
didFollow - A boolean that indicates whether users confirm that they want to follow the channel.
channelName - The channel that was followed.
requestIdShare
window.Twitch.ext.actions.requestIdShare: function()
This function opens a prompt for users to share their identity. After a successful identity link, the
Twitch.ext.onAuthorized
callback is invoked with the user’s ID. This function has no effect if:
Your extension does not have identity linking enabled.
It is called when the extension is installed on the user’s own channel.
Helper: Configuration
broadcaster
window.Twitch.ext.configuration.broadcaster: {version: string, content: string}|undefined
This property returns the record for the broadcaster segment if one is found; otherwise, undefined.
developer
window.Twitch.ext.configuration.developer: {version: string, content: string}|undefined
This property returns the record for the developer segment if one is found; otherwise, undefined.
global
window.Twitch.ext.configuration.global: {version: string, content: string}|undefined
This property returns the record for the global segment if one is found; otherwise, undefined.
onChanged
window.Twitch.ext.configuration.onChanged: void function (callback: Function)
This function registers a callback that is called whenever an extension configuration is received. The callback function takes no input and returns nothing. After this is called for the first time, the records for the global, developer and broadcaster segments will be set if the data is available.
set
window.Twitch.ext.configuration.set: void function (segment: String, version: String, content: String)
This function can be called by the front end to set an extension configuration. It uses the Twitch-provided JWT for broadcasters, to allow broadcasters to set a broadcaster configuration segment.
Property
Type
Description
segment
string
The configuration segment to set. Valid value:
"broadcaster"
.
version
string
The version of configuration with which the segment is stored.
content
string
The string-encoded configuration.
Helper: Feature Flags
isBitsEnabled
window.Twitch.ext.features.isBitsEnabled: Boolean
If this flag is
true
, Bits-in-Extensions features will work in your extension on the current channel.
If this flag is
false
, disable or hide the Bits in Extensions features in your extension.
This flag will be false if:
You did not enable Bits support in the
Monetization
tab in the Extensions manager.
The broadcaster is not eligible to receive Bits.
The broadcaster disabled Bits in Extensions features for your extension.
isChatEnabled
window.Twitch.ext.features.isChatEnabled: boolean
If this flag is
true
, you can send a chat message to the current channel using
Send Extension Chat Message
(subject to the authentication requirements documented for that endpoint). This flag may be false if:
You did not enable the “Chat Capabilities” option for your extension on the Twitch developer site.
The broadcaster disabled chat for your extension.
isSubscriptionStatusAvailable
window.Twitch.ext.features.isSubscriptionStatusAvailable: boolean
If this flag is
true
, your extension has the ability to get the subscription status of identity-linked viewers from both the helper in the
window.Twitch.ext.viewer.subscriptionStatus
object and via the Twitch API.
This flag may be false if:
You did not enable the “Subscription Status” option for your extension on the Twitch developer site.
The broadcaster did not grant your extension the permission to view their viewer’s subscriber status when they activated the extension, or they revoked that permission from the Manage Permissions page.
onChanged [features]
twitch.ext.features.onChanged: void function(callback: Function(changes: []string))
This function enables you to receive real-time updates to changes of the
features
object. If this callback is invoked, you should re-check the
window.Twitch.ext.features
object for a change to any feature flag your extension cares about. The callback is called with an array of feature flags which were updated.
callback
is a function with one argument:
Argument
Type
Description
changed
string[]
The callback which will be called when feature flags are updated. Feature flags are received in your extension from Twitch asynchronously, after the first call to
onAuthorized
. If you care about only the initial state, you can get that in your
onAuthorized
callback. If you need to know about updates, use
window.Twitch.ext.features.onChanged
.
Helper: Bits
Some functions use the
Product
object. Here is an example (fields are described under
getProducts
):
{
"sku": "carrot",
"displayName": "Carrot",
"cost": {
"amount": "500",
"type": "bits"
}
"inDevelopment": true
}
getProducts()
window.Twitch.ext.bits.getProducts: {Promise: Product[]}
This function returns a promise which resolves to an array of products available for Bits, for the extension, if the context supports Bits in Extensions actions. Otherwise, the promise rejects with an error; this can occur, for instance, if the extension is running in the legacy developer rig or an older version of the mobile app (earlier than V6.4), which does not support Bits in Extensions actions.
Products are returned only if the extension is configured for Bits (see the
Extensions Monetization Guide
). The products that are returned depend on the state of both the extension version (whether it is released) and the product (whether the kit is in development):
Is the extension version released?
Which products are returned?
Is the inDevelopment field included in the returned products?
Yes
Products whose catalog entries specify
inDevelopment
=
false
or
undefined
No
No
All products for that extension
Yes
Products have the following fields:
Product Field
Type
Description
cost
Cost
Cost object.
amount
string
Number of Bits required for the product.
type
string
Always the string
"bits"
. Reserved for future use.
displayName
string
Registered display name for the SKU.
inDevelopment
boolean or undefined
This field is returned only for extension versions that are not in the
Released
state. Valid values:
true - Indicates that the product's catalog entry specifies it is in development. If the developer tests the use of Bits, the Bits are
not
deducted from the user's balance.
false - Indicates that the product's catalog entry specifies it is not in development. If the developer tests the use of Bits, the Bits
are
deducted from the user's balance.
undefined - Indicates that the product's catalog entry does not specify anything about whether it is in development. If the developer tests the use of Bits, the Bits
are
deducted from the user's balance.
sku
string
Unique ID for the product.
onTransactionCancelled
twitch.ext.bits.onTransactionCancelled: void function(callback:Function)
This function takes a callback that is fired whenever a transaction is cancelled. A transaction can be cancelled in several ways:
The user clicks the
Cancel
button.
The user closes the confirmation dialog by clicking outside it.
The
useBits
function fails and the user dismisses the error dialog that is displayed.
onTransactionComplete
window.Twitch.ext.bits.onTransactionComplete: void function(callback: TransactionObject)
This function registers a callback that is fired whenever a Bits in Extensions transaction is completed. The callback receives a
TransactionObject
with these fields:
TransactionObject Field
Type
Description
displayName
string
Display name of the user who executed the Bits in Extensions transaction (i.e., exchanged Bits to "purchase" a Bits in Extensions "product").
initiator
enum
Valid values:
current_user
- the user who executed, or
initiated
, the transaction.
other
- a user other than
current_user
.
The
other
value indicates when this message is being sent to a user
other than
the one who executed the transaction. For example, suppose user A exchanges 10 Bits to set off a firework on a channel. Twitch processes the transaction, then sends a message to all instances of the extension:
On user A's machine, the extension gets an initiator value of
current_user
.
On the machines of all other users who have the extension, the initiator value is
other
.
In this way, the extension can easily display the firework in the browsers of all users who have the extension.
product
string
If set to
true
, will contain "
inDevelopment
". Otherwise it return blank.
domainID
string
Will be
twitch.ext
+ your extension ID.
transactionID
string
ID of the transaction.
transactionReceipt
string
JWT containing the following transaction information in the payload. The JWT is a large, base64-encoded string. It can be verified using your developer secret. (See
https://jwt.io/
for details on JWTs and verification.)
topic
enum
Indicates the type of receipt. Valid value:
bits_transaction_receipt
.
exp
string
Unix timestamp when this receipt expires.
data
JSON
Container for receipt payload data.
product
string
If set to
true
, will contain "
inDevelopment
". Otherwise it return blank.
domainID
string
Will be
twitch.ext
+ your extension ID.
time
string
UTC timestamp when this transaction occurred.
transactionId
string
ID of the transaction.
userId
string
Twitch ID of the user who executed the transaction.
userId
string
Twitch ID of the user who executed the transaction.
setUseLoopBack
window.Twitch.ext.bits.setUseLoopback: boolean
This function sets the state of the extension helper, so it does not call live services for usage of Bits. Instead, it does a local loopback to the completion handler, after a fixed delay to simulate user approval and process latency.
showBitsBalance
window.Twitch.ext.bits.showBitsBalance: void
Call this function when the viewer hovers over a product in your extension UI, to cause the Twitch UI to display a dialog showing the viewer’s Bits balance. The dialog displays for 1.5 seconds, unless your extension calls
showBitsBalance
again, in which case the 1.5-second timer resets.
This is a “fire-and-forget” function: the extension developer does not need to tell Twitch when the viewer stops hovering over the product.
On mobile, this function is ignored.
useBits
window.Twitch.ext.bits.useBits: void function(sku: String)
This function redeems a product with the specified SKU for the number of Bits specified in the catalog entry of that product. For more information, see
Exchanging Bits for a Product
.
Helper: Viewer
The Twitch.ext.viewer object is a collection of info about the Twitch viewer that is watching the channel page where your Extension is activated.
Much of the information stored here is also present in the Extension JWT, and is presented as part of this object for convenience. It is passed to the Extension iframe from the client without validation, so it is recommended that you use this info for rendering conditional UI elements, and that you pass the JWT to your EBS for validation if you are using any of this information to grant users permission to take privileged actions within your Extension.
opaqueId
window.Twitch.ext.viewer.opaqueId: string
The opaque id of the viewer.
id
window.Twitch.ext.viewer.id: string | null
The Twitch ID of a linked viewer. null if the viewer has not opted to share their identity with the extension.
role
window.Twitch.ext.viewer.role: string
The role of the user. See the JWT schema for possible values.
isLinked
window.Twitch.ext.viewer.isLinked: boolean
Provided as a convenience to check whether or not a user has shared their identity with their extension
sessionToken
window.Twitch.ext.viewer.sessionToken: string
The encoded JWT. This is the same as the token property of the authData parameter that currently gets passed to the onAuthorized callback.
helixToken
window.Twitch.ext.viewer.helixToken: string
The JWT that can be used for front end API requests. For more information, see
Using the Twitch API in an Extension Front End
.
subscriptionStatus
window.Twitch.ext.viewer.subscriptionStatus: SubscriptionStatus | null
Subscription status will be an object containing information about the viewer’s subscription. The
SubscriptionStatus
object will have the following properties:
Property
Type
Description
tier
String
null
The tier of the subscription. Possible values are
1000
2000
3000
for tier one, two, and three subscriptions respectively.
The value of
subscriptionStatus
will be
null
if the user is either not a subscriber, or opting not to share their identity. The value will also be
null
if the extension otherwise doesn’t have subscription capabilities.
onChanged
window.Twitch.ext.viewer.onChanged: void function(callback: Function())
This function binds a callback will be invoked when the viewer’s status changes (e.g. if a viewer subscribes and changes their subscription status).
Client Query Parameters
In addition to the context provided by the Javascript helper’s callbacks, the extension window receives the following query parameters, which indicate information about the extension environment that isn’t subject to change over the frame’s life cycle.
Name
Type
Description
anchor
string
The type of the anchor in which the extension is activated. Valid only when
platform
is
"web"
. Valid values:
"component"
,
"panel"
,
"video_overlay"
.
language
string
The user’s language setting (e.g.,
"en"
).
locale
string
The user’s language locale (e.g.
"en-US"
)
mode
string
The extension’s mode. Valid values:
"config"
,
"dashboard"
,
"viewer"
.
platform
string
The platform on which the Twitch client is running. Valid values:
"mobile"
,
"web"
.
popout
boolean
Indicates whether the extension is popped out. If
true
, the extension is running in its own window; otherwise,
false
.
state
string
The release state of the extension. Valid values:
"testing"
,
"hosted_test"
,
"approved"
,
"released"
,
"ready_for_review"
,
"in_review"
,
"pending_action"
,
"uploading"
.
JWT Schema
Schema Item
Type
Description
channel_id
string
Numeric ID of the channel from which your front-end is being served.
exp
NumericDate
Expiration time for the JWT, expressed as seconds since Jan 1, 1970. (For a definition of NumericDate, see
Terminology
in the JWT RFC.)
is_unlinked
boolean
true
when the token is for a user that previously shared identity; otherwise,
false
.
opaque_user_id
string
Identifies the session using this JWT. Any token generated by your EBS should leave this field blank. When present, the value is interpreted as follows:
Values beginning with "U" are stable references to a Twitch account across sessions and channels. You can use them to provide persistent services to users.
Values beginning with "A" are transient references to an anonymous Twitch session; the user has not logged into the Twitch website.
These values are not stable and should never be associated with persistent data.
It is possible for them to represent different users over time. If your extension requires a stable user identity, your front-end interface should display an appropriate login request when this field does not begin with "U."
Broadcasters' tokens are set with "U" + their Twitch user IDs, to avoid confusing opaque IDs with user IDs when the broadcaster is a viewer.
pubsub_perms
object
Defines the ability of the token holder to send and listen to messages for your extension.
pubsub_perms
contains two arrays:
listen
and
send
, which contain the topics the associated user is allowed to listen to and publish to, respectively.
A wildcard/asterisk means the associated user can listen/publish to all topics associated with that extension/channel combination. A list of specific values means only the specified targets are allowed. If a permission is absent, it is equivalent to the empty listing: there are no default allowed targets. When sending messages from the EBS, specify an asterisk as the
send
permission, to allow the message to pass through the system.
For an example, see
Example JWT Payload
.
role
string
Type of user for whom this JWT has been signed. This is required. Valid values:
broadcaster — The owner of the channel, who should have configuration rights.
moderator — A viewer who has moderation rights on the channel. This is provided only for users who allow your extension to identify them.
viewer — A user watching the channel.
external — The token is not from a Twitch token generator. Your EBS should use this value to generate tokens when it broadcasts messages.
Multiple endpoints require this role.
user_id
string
The user's Twitch user ID. This is provided only for users who allow your extension to identify them. There are no guarantees this will be available, as users can revoke an extension's ability to identify them at any time. Users who revoke an extension's ability to identify them are issued a new opaque identifier.
