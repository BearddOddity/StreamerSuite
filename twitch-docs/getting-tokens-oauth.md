Getting OAuth Access Tokens
Twitch APIs require access tokens to access resources. Depending on the resource you’re accessing, you’ll need a
user access token
or
app access token
. The API’s
reference content
identifies the type of access token you’ll need. The simple difference between the two types of tokens is that a user access token lets you access a user’s sensitive data (with their permission) and an app access token lets you access their non-sensitive data only (and doesn’t require the user’s permission).
If the APIs you’re calling require an OAuth app or user access token, use one of the following flows to get the token:
Flow
Token Type
Description
Implicit grant flow
User access token
Use this flow if your app does not use a server. For example, use this flow if your app is a client-side JavaScript app or mobile app.
Client credentials grant flow
App access token
Use this flow if your app uses a server, can securely store a client secret, and can make server-to-server requests to the Twitch API. This flow is meant for apps that only need an app access token.
Authorization code grant flow
User access token
Use this flow if your app uses a server, can securely store a client secret, and can make server-to-server requests to the Twitch API.
Device code grant flow
User access token
Use this flow if your app is run on a client with limited input capabilities, such as set-top boxes or video games.
NOTE
Third-party apps that call the Twitch APIs and maintain an OAuth session
must
call the
/validate
endpoint to verify that the access token is still valid.

Implicit grant flow
This flow is meant for apps that don’t use a server, such as client-side JavaScript apps or mobile apps.
To get a user access token using the
implicit grant flow
, navigate the user to
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize
. For example, if your service is a website, you can add an HTML hyperlink for the user to click.
<a href="https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?[parameters]">Connect with Twitch</a>
Specify the following query parameters as appropriate for your application.
Parameter
Required?
Type
Description
client_id
Yes
String
Your app’s
registered
client ID.
force_verify
No
Boolean
Set to
true
to force the user to re-authorize your app’s access to their resources. The default is
false
.
redirect_uri
Yes
URI
Your app’s registered redirect URI. The access token is sent to this URI.
response_type
Yes
String
Must be set to
token
.
scope
Yes
String
A space-delimited list of scopes. The APIs that you’re calling identify the scopes you must list. You must URL encode the list.
state
No
String
Although optional, you are
strongly encouraged
to pass a state string to help prevent
Cross-Site Request Forgery
(CSRF) attacks. The server returns this string to you in your redirect URI (see the
state
parameter in the fragment portion of the URI). If this string doesn’t match the state string that you passed, ignore the response. The state string should be randomly generated and unique for each OAuth request.
The following URI is an example of the URI that you’ll navigate to in your web browser control (the URI is formatted for easier reading).
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize
?response_type=token
&client_id=hof5gwx0su6owfnys0yan9c87zr6t
&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000
&scope=channel%3Amanage%3Apolls+channel%3Aread%3Apolls
&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
If the user is logged into Twitch, Twitch asks them to authorize your application’s access to the specified resources. If they’re not logged in, Twitch first asks them to log in and then asks them to authorize your application.
If the user authorizes your application by clicking
Authorize
, the server sends the access token to your redirect URI
in the fragment portion
of the URI (see the
access_token
parameter):
http://localhost:3000/
#access_token=73d0f8mkabpbmjp921asv2jaidwxn
&scope=channel%3Amanage%3Apolls+channel%3Aread%3Apolls
&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
&token_type=bearer
NOTE
In JavaScript, you can access the fragment using
document.location.hash
.
If the user didn’t authorize your app, the server sends the error code and description to your redirect URI (see the
error
and
error_description
query parameters).
http://localhost:3000/
?error=access_denied
&error_description=The+user+denied+you+access
&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
Client credentials grant flow
The
client credentials grant flow
is meant only for server-to-server API requests that use an app access token.
To get an access token, send an HTTP POST request to
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token
. Set the following x-www-form-urlencoded parameters as appropriate for your app.
Parameter
Required?
Type
Description
client_id
Yes
String
Your app’s
registered
client ID.
client_secret
Yes
String
Your app’s registered client secret.
grant_type
Yes
String
Must be set to
client_credentials
.
The following example shows the parameters in the body of the POST (the parameters are formatted for easier reading).
client_id=hof5gwx0su6owfnys0yan9c87zr6t
&client_secret=41vpdji4e9gif29md0ouet6fktd2
&grant_type=client_credentials
If the request succeeds, it returns an access token.

Authorization code grant flow
This flow is meant for apps that use a server, can securely store a client secret, and can make server-to-server requests to the Twitch API. To get a user access token using the
authorization code grant flow
, your app must
Get the user to authorize your app
and then
Use the authorization code to get a token
.
Get the user to authorize your app
The first step is to get the user to authorize your application’s access to their resources. To get the authorization, in your web browser control, navigate the user to
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize
. For example, if your service is a website, you can add an HTML hyperlink for the user to click.
<a href="https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?[parameters]">Connect with Twitch</a>
Specify the following query parameters as appropriate for your application.
Parameter
Required?
Type
Description
client_id
Yes
String
Your app’s
registered
client ID.
force_verify
No
Boolean
Set to
true
to force the user to re-authorize your app’s access to their resources. The default is
false
.
redirect_uri
Yes
URI
Your app’s registered redirect URI. The authorization code is sent to this URI.
response_type
Yes
String
Must be set to
code
.
scope
Yes
String
A space-delimited list of scopes. The APIs that you’re calling will identify the scopes you must list. You must URL encode the list.
state
No
String
Although optional, you are
strongly encouraged
to pass a state string to help prevent
Cross-Site Request Forgery
(CSRF) attacks. The server returns this string to you in your redirect URI (see the
state
parameter in the fragment portion of the URI). If this string doesn’t match the state string that you passed, ignore the response. The state string should be randomly generated and unique for each OAuth request.
The following URI shows an example request that you’ll navigate to in your web browser control (the URI is formatted for easier reading).
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize
?response_type=code
&client_id=hof5gwx0su6owfnys0nyan9c87zr6t
&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000
&scope=channel%3Amanage%3Apolls+channel%3Aread%3Apolls
&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
If the user is logged into Twitch, Twitch asks them to authorize your application’s access to the specified resources. If they’re not logged in, Twitch first asks them to log in and then asks them to authorize your application.
If the user authorized your app by clicking
Authorize
, the server sends the authorization code to your redirect URI (see the
code
query parameter):
http://localhost:3000/
?code=gulfwdmys5lsm6qyz4xiz9q32l10
&scope=channel%3Amanage%3Apolls+channel%3Aread%3Apolls
&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
If the user didn’t authorize your app, the server sends the error code and description to your redirect URI (see the
error
and
error_description
query parameters):
http://localhost:3000/
?error=access_denied
&error_description=The+user+denied+you+access
&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
Use the authorization code to get a token
The second step in this flow is to use the authorization code (see above) to get an access token and refresh token.
To get the tokens, send an HTTP POST request to
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token
. Set the following x-www-form-urlencoded parameters in the body of the POST.
Parameter
Required?
Type
Description
client_id
Yes
String
Your app’s
registered
client ID.
client_secret
Yes
String
Your app’s registered client secret.
code
Yes
String
The code that the
/authorize
response returned in the
code
query parameter.
grant_type
Yes
String
Must be set to
authorization_code
.
redirect_uri
Yes
URI
Your app’s registered redirect URI.
The following example shows the parameters in the body of the POST (the parameters are formatted for easier reading).
client_id=hof5gwx0su6owfnys0yan9c87zr6t
&client_secret=41vpdji4e9gif29md0ouet6fktd2
&code=gulfwdmys5lsm6qyz4xiz9q32l10
&grant_type=authorization_code
&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000
If the request succeeds, it returns an access token and refresh token.

[
"channel:moderate"
,

,
"chat:read"
],
"token_type"
:

}
When the access token expires, use the refresh token to get a new access token. For information about using refresh tokens, see
Refreshing Access Tokens
.
Device code grant flow
This flow is designed for applications which do not use a server and are located on a stand alone device, such as a set-top box or a video game console.
Device Code Grant Flow (DCF) allows for public and confidential client types. The major
differences
between a public and confidential client type is that public clients:
Do not need to maintain a client secret.
Can refresh an access token without passing a client secret.
Are only limited to the usage of device authorization grant flow to obtain OAuth tokens and cannot use any of the other flows like client credentials, implicit grant flow highlighted
above
.
Although the public clients do not need a client secret to obtain an access token there are some important details to be noted about the DCF related refresh tokens. For more information about using refresh tokens, see
Refreshing Access Tokens
:
These tokens are for
one time use only
, meaning if they are used in refreshing a token they will become invalid after use.
There is an expiry on the refresh token which is inactive, which is set to
30 days
. After a refresh token expires the user is expected to start the DCF flow once again to obtain a new refresh token. Both the refresh tokens and the access tokens can be stored safely in the user’s device as HttpOnly cookies.
All access tokens obtained have the same expiry like before, i.e.
4 hours
.
Generally, if you device is secure, then
confidential
is the client type you should use, however if your application is on a more open platform (such as windows) we suggest using
public
.
Starting the DCF Flow for your user
The first step is to make the following cURL command from your client. This cURL command starts a device authorization grant code flow for your client.
Specify the following query parameters as appropriate for your application.
Parameter
Required?
Type
Description
client_id
Yes
String
Your app’s
registered
Client ID.
scopes
Yes
String
A space-delimited list of scopes. The APIs that you’re calling identify the scopes you must list. You must URL encode the list.
curl
-X
POST
--location
'https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/device'
\
--form
'client_id="<clientID>"'
\
--form
'scopes="<scopes>"'
The response to this call will contain:
Parameter
Type
Description
device_code
String
The identifier for a given user.
expires_in
Int
Time until the code is no longer valid
interval
Int
Time until another valid code can be requested
user_code
String
The code that the user will use to authenticate
verification_uri
String
The address you will send users to, to authenticate
{
"device_code"
:
"ike3GM8QIdYZs43KdrWPIO36LofILoCyFEzjlQ91"
,
"expires_in"
:
1800
,
"interval"
:
5
,
"user_code"
:
"ABCDEFGH"
,
"verification_uri"
:
"https://www.twitch.tv/activate?public=true&device-code=ABCDEFGH"
}
Authorization Step
The user is presented with an authorization screen to review the scopes and complete the authorization.
Obtaining the refresh token/access token pair
The next step for the client is to obtain the refresh token/access token pair for this current completed authorization. To do that we will utilize the device_code sent in the response of the first step. This
grant_type
is the RFC standard
urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code
, which signals our Authorization server that the client is trying to exchange the device code for a refresh_token/access_token pair.
cURL Request
Parameter
Required
Type
Description
location
Yes
String
URL used to request a token from Twitch. Will always be the same.
client_id
Yes
String
Your app’s
registered
client ID.
scopes
Yes
String
A space-delimited list of scopes. The APIs that you’re calling identify the scopes you must list. You must URL encode the list.
device_code
Yes
String
The code that will authenticate the user.
grant_type
Yes
String
Must be set to
urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code
.
curl
--location
'https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token'
\
--form
'client_id="<client_id>"'
\
--form
'scopes="<scopes>"'
\
--form
'device_code="<device_code>"'
\
--form
'grant_type="urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code"'
Response
Parameter
Type
Description
access_token
String
The authenticated token, to be used for various API endpoints and EventSub subscriptions.
expires_in
Int
Time until the code is no longer valid.
refresh_token
String
A token used to refresh the access token.
scope
String
An array of the scopes requested.
token_type
String
Will generally be “bearer”.
{
"access_token"
:
"<access_token>"
,
"expires_in"
:
<some_int_value>
,
"refresh_token"
:
"<refresh_token>"
,
"scope"
:
[
"<scopes>"
],
"token_type"
:
"bearer"
}
Once the access_token and refresh_tokens are received, the client should store these tokens for future exchange token calls using the refresh_token grant type which is highlighted in the step 5.
Before the user completes the authorization, the client cannot obtain the tokens, in this scenario we will send the following response when the client attempts to obtain the token using the device code.
{
"status"
:
400
,
"message"
:
"authorization_pending"
}
The device_code is one time use only, once the device_code has been used to obtain the tokens the client will receive the following response from the authorization server.
{
"status"
:
400
,
"message"
:
"invalid device code"
}
Finally a client can keep using the refresh_token grant to exchange a refresh_token for a new access_token. As mentioned earlier the refresh_token is
one time use only
and will be invalid once the token is exchanged. The client will then be presented with the following response if used more than once.
{
"status"
:
400
,
"message"
:
"Invalid refresh token"
}
Examples of the four flows
If you don’t want to write code to test the OAuth flows in this topic, try the following options. Before continuing, you’ll need to
register an app
to get a client ID and secret that you can use below. When registering your app, use
http://localhost:3000
for your redirect URI.
Implicit flow example
Open your favorite browser and enter the following URI in the address bar. Substitute your client ID for the placeholder string.
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=<your client id goes here>&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000&scope=channel%3Amanage%3Apolls+channel%3Aread%3Apolls&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
If you’re not already signed in to your Twitch account, you’ll be asked to sign in. If this client ID hasn’t previously requested access to your Poll resource, you’ll be asked to give consent. If you want to always force consent, include the
force_verify
query parameter.
If you consented, the address bar is set to your redirect URI and it contains the access token (see
access_token
in the URI’s fragment).
http://localhost:3000/#access_token=wt6oxekssgvj53dkf38grzyzh2xe&scope=channel%3Amanage%3Apolls+channel%3Aread%3Apolls&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671&token_type=bearer
Authorization code flow example
Open your favorite browser and enter the following URI in the address bar. Substitute your client ID for the placeholder string.
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<your client id goes here>&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000&scope=channel%3Amanage%3Apolls+channel%3Aread%3Apolls&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
If you’re not already signed in to your Twitch account, you’ll be asked to sign in. If this client ID hasn’t previously requested access to your Poll resource, you’ll be asked to give consent. If you want to always force consent, include the
force_verify
query parameter.
If you consented, the address bar is set to your redirect URI and it contains the authorization code (see the
code
parameter).
http://localhost:3000/?code=17038swieks1jh1hwcdr36hekyui&scope=channel%3Amanage%3Apolls+channel%3Aread%3Apolls&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
Open a terminal window and enter the following cURL POST command (you’ll need
cURL installed
on your computer). Replace the placeholder strings and the authorization code with your values.
curl
-X
POST
'https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token'
\
-H
'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
\
-d
'client_id=<your client id goes here>&client_secret=<your client secret goes here>&code=17038swieks1jh1hwcdr36hekyui&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000'
The response contains a JSON object with the access token and refresh token.
{
"access_token"
:
"fvc8xeeajsh0zkunt6fby67rnyux1"
,
"expires_in"
:
15485
,
"refresh_token"
:
"e2zyj5itwcmlg2clbcnd1wqlibypzjjydwu26bfhqhx1klp2o"
,
"scope"
:
[
"channel:manage:polls"
,
"channel:read:polls"
],
"token_type"
:
"bearer"
}
Client credentials flow example
Open a terminal window and enter the following cURL POST command (you’ll need
cURL installed
on your computer).
curl
-X
POST
'https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token'
\
-H
'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
\
-d
'client_id=<your client id goes here>&client_secret=<your client secret goes here>&grant_type=client_credentials'
The response contains a JSON object with the access token.
{
"access_token"
:
"jostpf5q0puzmxmkba9iyug38kjtg"
,
"expires_in"
:
5011271
,
"token_type"
:
"bearer"
}
Device code flow example
The device will make a cURL request with requested scopes.
curl
-X
POST
'https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/device'
\
-H
'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
\
-d
'client_id=<Your client id here>&scopes=<Your scope here>'
The response will contain a URI.
{
"device_code"
:
"ikeYZs43KdrWPIO363GM8QIdLofILoCyFEzjlQ91"
,
"expires_in"
:
1800
,
"interval"
:
5
,
"user_code"
:
"ABCDEFGH"
,
"verification_uri"
:
"https://www.twitch.tv/activate?public=true&device-code=ABCDEFGH"
}
The device will show the user the URI to navigate to, in the above example it’s
https://www.twitch.tv/activate?public=true&device-code=ABCDEFGH
.
Once the user has accepted the authorization the device will call
curl
--location
'https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token'
\
--form
'client_id="0mmkby2n450y6ho3s2b4xth9fjggz1"'
\
--form
'scope="channel:manage:broadcast"'
\
--form
'device_code="ike3GM8QIdYZs43KdrWPIO36LofILoCyFEzjlQ91"'
\
--form
'grant_type="urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code"'
Which will get a response with the access token and the refresh token.
{
"access_token"
:
"<access_token>"
,
"expires_in"
:
14820
,
"refresh_token"
:
"<refresh_token>"
,
"scope"
:
[
"user:edit"
],
"token_type"
:
"bearer"
}
