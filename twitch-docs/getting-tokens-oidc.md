Using OIDC to get OAuth Access Tokens
Twitch supports getting OAuth user access tokens using
OpenID Connect
. For information about the claims that you can request, see
Requesting claims
.
To get an OAuth user access token, use one of the following flows:
Flow
Description
OIDC Implicit grant flow
User access token
Use this flow if your app does not use a server. For example, use this flow if your app is a client-side JavaScript app or mobile app.
OIDC Authorization code grant flow
User access token
Use this flow if your app uses a server, can securely store a client secret, and can make server-to-server requests to the Twitch API.
NOTE
If you need an app access token, you must use the
client credentials flow
.
Discovering supported claims and authorization URIs
To discover the claims that Twitch supports, send an HTTP GET request to
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/.well-known/openid-configuration
. The
claims_supported
field contains the list of claims. The response also includes supported response types and URIs that you use for authorization. The discovery information lets you easily integrate with standard OIDC clients like
AWS Cognito
.
The following example shows Twitch’s OIDC configuration.

How do I use the URIs?
URI
Used to…
authorization_endpoint
Used to get an access token if you’re using the
OIDC Implicit grant flow
or an authorization code if you’re using the
OIDC Authorization code grant flow
.
token_endpoint
Used to get an access token if you’re using the
OIDC Authorization code grant flow
.
jwks_uri
Used to validate an ID token. See
Validating an ID token
.
userinfo_endpoint
Used to get claims from an OAuth access token. See
Getting claims information from an access token
.
How do I use the supported claims?
Used to set the
claims
parameter, which tells the server which claims to include with the OAuth access token and ID token. See
Requesting claims
.
How do I use the response types?
Used to set the
response_type
parameter, which tells the server which types of tokens you want the authorization request to return.
OIDC implicit grant flow
This flow is meant for apps that don’t use a server, such as client-side JavaScript apps or mobile apps.
To get a user access token using the
implicit grant flow
, navigate a user to
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize
with the following query parameters that are appropriate for your application. This can be done via your application control logic or simply by adding an HTML hyperlink for a user to click if your service is a website  (e.g.
<a href="https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?[parameters]">Connect with Twitch</a>
).
Parameter
Required?
Type
Description
claims
No
String
A string-encoded JSON object that specifies the claims to include in the ID token. For information about claims, see
Requesting claims
.
client_id
Yes
String
Your app’s
registered
client ID.
force_verify
No
Boolean
Set to
true
to force the user to re-authorize your app’s access to their resources. The default is
false
.
nonce
No
String
Although optional, you are
strongly encouraged
to pass a nonce string to help prevent
Cross-Site Request Forgery
(CSRF) attacks. The server returns this string to you in the ID token’s list of claims. If this string doesn’t match the nonce string that you passed, ignore the response. The nonce string should be randomly generated and unique for each OAuth request. Use this parameter if
response_type
includes
id_token
.
redirect_uri
Yes
URI
Your app’s
registered
redirect URI. The access token and ID token are sent to this URI.
response_type
Yes
String
Must be set to one of the following possible values:
token id_token &mdash; Returns an access token and an ID token. You must URL encode the type (for example,
token+id_token
).
id_token &mdash; Returns only an ID token. You might use this option if you have a valid access token and just want to include information about the authorizing user in the ID token.
scope
Yes
String
A space-delimited list of scopes. The APIs that you’re calling identify the scopes you must list. The list must include the
openid
scope if
response_type
includes
id_token
or you want to include the non-default claims (see
Requesting claims
). Don’t forget to URL encode the list.
state
No
String
Although optional, you are
strongly encouraged
to pass a state string to help prevent
Cross-Site Request Forgery
(CSRF) attacks. The server returns this string to you in your redirect URI (see the
state
parameter in the fragment portion of the URI). If this string doesn’t match the state string that you passed, ignore the response. The state string should be randomly generated and unique for each OAuth request. Use this parameter if
response_type
includes
token
.
The following URI shows an example of the URI that you’ll navigate to in your web browser control (the URI is formatted for easier reading).
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize
?response_type=token+id_token
&client_id=hof5gwx0su6owfnys0nyan9c87zr6t
&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000
&scope=channel%3Amanage%3Apolls+channel%3Aread%3Apolls+openid

&nonce=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
If the user is logged in, Twitch asks them to authorize your app’s access to the specified resources. If they’re not logged in, Twitch first asks them to log in and then asks them to authorize your app.
If the user authorized your app by clicking
Authorize
, the server sends the access token and ID token to your redirect URI
in the fragment portion
of the URI (see the
access_token
and
id_token
parameters). Remember, the nonce is in the claims portion of the ID token’s payload.
http://localhost:3000/
#access_token=73gl5dipwta5fsfma3ia05woyffbp
&id_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cC6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6IjEifQ...
&scope=channel%253Amanage%253Apolls+channel%253Aread%253Apolls+openid
&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
&token_type=bearer
NOTE
In JavaScript, you can access the fragment using
document.location.hash
.
If the user didn’t authorize your app, the server sends the error code and description to your redirect URI (see the
error
and
error_description
query parameters).
http://localhost:3000/
?error=access_denied
&error_description=The+user+denied+you+access
&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
For information about the claims that your tokens include by default, see
Requesting claims
.
For information about validating the ID token, see
Validating an ID token
.
OIDC authorization code grant flow
This flow is meant for apps that use a server, can securely store a client secret, and can make server-to-server requests to the Twitch API. To get a user access token using the
authorization code grant flow
, your app performs the following steps:
Get the user to authorize your app
The first step is to get the user to authorize your app’s access to their resources. To get the authorization, in your web browser control, navigate to
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize
. Set the following query parameters as appropriate for your app.
Parameter
Required?
Type
Description
claims
No
String
A string-encoded JSON object that specifies the claims to include in the ID token. For information about claims, see
Requesting claims
.
client_id
Yes
String
Your app’s
registered
client ID.
force_verify
No
Boolean
Set to
true
to force the user to re-authorize your app’s access to their resources. The default is
false
.
nonce
No
String
Although optional, you are
strongly encouraged
to pass a nonce string to help prevent
Cross-Site Request Forgery
(CSRF) attacks. The server returns this string to you in the ID token’s list of claims. If this string doesn’t match the nonce string that you passed, ignore the response. The nonce string should be randomly generated and unique for each OAuth request.
redirect_uri
Yes
URI
Your app’s
registered
redirect URI. The authorization code is sent to this URI.
response_type
Yes
String
Must be set to
code
.
scope
Yes
String
A space-delimited list of scopes. The APIs that you’re calling identify the scopes you must list. The list must include the
openid
scope. Don’t forget to URL encode the list.
state
No
String
Although optional, you are
strongly encouraged
to pass a state string to help prevent
Cross-Site Request Forgery
(CSRF) attacks. The server returns this string to you in your redirect URI (see the
state
parameter in the fragment portion of the URI). If this string doesn’t match the state string that you passed, ignore the response. The state string should be randomly generated and unique for each OAuth request.
The following URI shows an example request that you’ll navigate to in your web browser control (the URI is formatted for easier reading).
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize
?response_type=code
&client_id=hof5gwx0su6owfnys0nyan9c87zr6t
&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000
&scope=channel%3Amanage%3Apolls+channel%3Aread%3Apolls+openid
&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
&nonce=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
If the user is logged in, Twitch asks them to authorize your app’s access to the specified resources. If they’re not logged in, Twitch first asks them to log in and then asks them to authorize your app.
If the user authorized your app by clicking
Authorize
, the server sends the authorization code to your redirect URI (see the
code
query parameter):
http://localhost:3000/
?code=gulfwdmys5lsm6qyz4ximz9q32l10
&scope=channel%3Amanage%3Apolls+channel%3Aread%3Apolls+openid
&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
If the user didn’t authorize your app, the server sends the error code and description to your redirect URI (see the
error
and
error_description
query parameters):
http://localhost:3000/
?error=access_denied
&error_description=The+user+denied+you+access
&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
Use the authorization code to get a token
The second step is to use the authorization code (see above) to get an access token, refresh token, and ID token.
To get the tokens, send an HTTP POST request to
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token
. Set the following x-www-form-urlencoded parameters in the body of the POST.
Parameter
Required?
Type
Description
client_id
Yes
String
Your app’s
registered
client ID.
client_secret
Yes
String
Your app’s registered client secret.
code
Yes
String
The code that the
/authorize
response returned in the
code
query parameter.
grant_type
Yes
String
Must be set to
authorization_code
.
redirect_uri
Yes
URI
Your app’s registered redirect URI.
The following example shows the parameters in the body of the POST (the parameters are formatted for easier reading).
client_id=hof5gwx0su6owfnys0nyan9c87zr6t
&client_secret=41vpdji4e9gif429md0ouet6fktd2
&code=gulfwdmys5lsm6qyz4ximz9q32l10
&grant_type=authorization_code
&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000
If the request succeeds, it returns an access token, refresh token, and ID token.
{
"access_token"
:
"rfx2uswqe8lu4g1mkagrvg5tv0ks3"
,
"expires_in"
:

}
When the access token expires, use the refresh token to get a new access token. For information about using the refresh token, see
Refreshing Access Tokens
.
For information about the claims that your tokens include by default, see
Requesting claims
.
For information about validating the ID token, see
Validating an ID token
.
Requesting claims
Claims identify information about the user that authorized your app. The following list identifies the claims that your access token and ID token include by default.
Claim
Data
aud
The client ID of the application that requested the user’s authorization.
azp
The client ID of the application that received the user’s authorization. This contains the same value as
aud
.
exp
The UNIX timestamp of when the token expires.
iat
The UNIX timestamp of when the server issued the token.
iss
The URI of the issuing authority.
sub
The ID of the user that authorized the app.
NOTE
If your authorization request specifies the
nonce
query parameter, the ID token’s payload also includes the
nonce
claim.
The following list contains the claims that you can also request.
Claim
Data
email
The email address of the user that authorized the app.
Note:
If
email_verified
is
false
, then this field will return
null
email_verified
A Boolean value that indicates whether Twitch has verified the user’s email address. Is
true
if Twitch has verified the user’s email address.
picture
A URL to the user’s profile image if they included one; otherwise, a default image.
preferred_username
The user’s display name.
updated_at
The date and time that the user last updated their profile.
To include the non-default claims, include the
claims
query parameter in your
/authorize
request. Set the
claims
query parameter to a string-encoded JSON object. The JSON object may contain the
id_token
and
userinfo
fields. Set
id_token
field to an object that specifies the claims that you want to include in the ID token, and set the
userinfo
field to an object that specifies the claims that you want to retrieve using the
UserInfo
endpoint. Each claim is a
name/value
pair, where
name
is the claim (e.g., email) and
value
is
null
.
You may specify the claims in the
id_token
field or the
userinfo
field or both fields. There are no uniqueness constraints — you may specify the same claim in both fields. The following claims object tells the server to include the user’s email and email verification state in the ID token and make the user’s profile image available through the
UserInfo
endpoint.
{
"id_token"
:
{
"email"
:
null
,
"email_verified"
:
null
},
"userinfo"
:
{
"picture"
:
null
}
}
The following example shows the
claims
query parameter set to the above claims object.
claims={"id_token":{"email":null,"email_verified":null},"userinfo":{"picture":null}}
NOTE
If you specify the
email
or
email_verified
claims, you must include the
user:read:email
scope in your list of scopes.
Getting claims information from an access token
To get the claims information from an access token, send an HTTP GET request to the
/userinfo
endpoint. You may call this endpoint only with an OAuth access token; you may not call it using an ID token.
curl -X GET 'https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/userinfo' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
-H 'Authorization: Bearer o8cf726oyya7xu47y99a68pv5ih6c'
The response is a JSON object that contains the default claims and any non-default claims that you specified in the authorization request.

Validating an ID token
Validating the ID token is an important security measure to ensure the authenticity of the token and guard against tampering.
To verify an ID token’s signature, you need the following pieces of information.
The issuer. For example,
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2
. The token’s payload includes the issuer in
iss
claim.
The app’s client ID. The token’s payload includes the client ID in the
aud
claim.
The signing algorithm that Twitch uses to create its JSON Web Key (JWK). For example, RS256. To get this information, call Twitch’s
discovery endpoint
. The response’s
id_token_signing_alg_values_supported
field identifies the algorithm.
Twitch’s public JWK. For example,
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/keys
. To get the URI to Twitch’s JWK, call Twitch’s
discovering endpoint
. The response’s
jwks_uri
field identifies the URI.
For more details and an example that shows how to use this information to validate ID tokens, see
How to validate an OpenID Connect ID token
.
Examples of the two flows
If you don’t want to write code to test the OIDC flows in this topic, try the following options. Before continuing, you’ll need to
register an app
to get a client ID and secret that you can use below. When registering your app, use
http://localhost:3000
for your redirect URI.
Implicit flow example
Open your favorite browser and enter the following URI in the address bar. Substitute your client ID for the placeholder string.
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token+id_token&client_id=<your client id goes here>&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000&scope=channel%3Amanage%3Apolls+channel%3Aread%3Apolls+openid+user%3Aread%3Aemail&claims={"id_token":{"email":null,"email_verified":null},"userinfo":{"email":null,"email_verified":null,"picture":null,"updated_at":null}}&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671&nonce=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
If you’re not already signed into your Twitch account, you’ll be asked to sign in. If this client ID hasn’t previously requested access to your Poll resource, you’ll be asked to give consent. If you want to always force consent, include the
force_verify
query parameter.
If you gave consent, the address bar is set to your redirect URI and it contains the access token and ID token (see the
access_token
and
id_token
parameters in the URI’s fragment).
http://localhost:3000/#access_token=zvpmzpt4mz5hceho6pgf1m9erzm1e&id_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkXVCIsImtpZCI6IjEifQ.eyJhdWQiOiJob2Y1Z3d4MHN1Nm93Zm55czBueWFuOWM4N3pyNnQiLCJleHAiOjE2NDQ1MTY4MjQsImlhdCI6MTY0NDUxNTkyNCwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9pZC50d2l0Y2gudHYvb2F1dGgyIiwic3ViIjoiNzEzOTM2NzMzIiwiYXRfaGFzaCI6Inc0dHl0eEg3N0piYXpkVzBka2d4UGciLCJlbWFpbCI6InNjb3R3aHRAanVzdGluLnR2IiwiZW1haWxfdmVyaWZpZWQiOnRydWV9.S2V1ZPILEoHUYw3uQtyl_PoPDuAB6z4KjrfXwtAJtKKKOTBsQQIlLIyGVZHqeYmYNW4EG9GTdoopP4RUb_2ETGAoMbQCZsjRnqYI8SAu58yChxRR0iI7tbbC-7j4d2KPGmdSG651uWQHCtRHd1fBfxCrFuaiwH_PoPkI6YQUB6-moscqr7hpHM_3SSP4Nzts9OeSIS52FawcMbeLXKROZDj7MhsktwVhNaQBAdNRJjqeUEL_V6RF_VhxY8iZbv73YJxfcA7O-fjHzEy00Lq7y-pjd_5TSLvkdheNUCdtKEI4tA_9IZzqrOtmy20pGKF4ovKy-HtASH_qEvswmMxD7A&scope=channel%253Amanage%253Apolls+channel%253Aread%253Apolls+openid+user%253Aread%253Aemail&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671&token_type=bearer
Authorization code flow example
Open your favorite browser and enter the following URI in the address bar. Substitute your client ID for the placeholder string.
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<your client id goes here>&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000&scope=channel%3Amanage%3Apolls+channel%3Aread%3Apolls+openid+user%3Aread%3Aemail&claims={"id_token":{"email":null,"email_verified":null},"userinfo":{"email":null,"email_verified":null,"picture":null,"updated_at":null}}&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671&nonce=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
If you’re not already signed into your Twitch account, you’ll be asked to sign in. If this client ID hasn’t previously requested access to your Poll resource, you’ll be asked to give consent. If you want to always force consent, include the
force_verify
query parameter.
If you gave consent, the address bar is set to your redirect URI and it contains the authorization code.
http://localhost:3000/#code=88va56epq1t98c4km4lune8l4alzv&scope=channel%253Amanage%253Apolls+channel%253Aread%253Apolls+openid+user%253Aread%253Aemail&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671
Open a terminal window and enter the following cURL POST command (you’ll need
cURL installed
on your computer). Replace the placeholder strings and the authorization code with your values.
curl
-X
POST
'https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token'
\
-H
'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
\
-d
'client_id=<your client id goes here>&client_secret=<your client secret goes here>&code=88va56epq1t98c4km4lune8l4alzv&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000'
The response contains a JSON object with the access token, refresh token, and ID token.
