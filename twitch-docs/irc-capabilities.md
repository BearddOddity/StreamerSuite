IRC Concepts
Reviews for chatbot verification continue to be temporarily paused while we revise our processes. Reviews for Extensions, developer organizations, and game ownership have resumed. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
Twitch IRC is a chat interface provided by Twitch based on a modified RFC1459 and IRCv3 Message Tag specification. While Twitch’s IRC server generally follows RFC1459, it doesn’t support all IRC messages. Twitch IRC has limited features, and for full chatbot functionality some API calls will need to be made, such as in the case of
using chat commands
.
Twitch IRC has some limitations versus EventSub, and is more complicated to parse, so it is recommended that you use EventSub subscriptions and API calls instead.
Connecting to the Twitch IRC Server
To connect to the Twitch IRC server, use one of the following URIs:
WebSocket clients
IRC clients
SSL
wss://irc-ws.chat.twitch.tv:443
irc://irc.chat.twitch.tv:6697
Non-SSL
Unavailable (
see announcement
)
irc://irc.chat.twitch.tv:6667
Requesting Twitch Capabilities
Once the connection is established, you have the option to request additional metadata to be included in messages sent to your chatbot. This is done using the using the
REQ
subcommand specified in the
IRC v3 capability negotiation
specification. You have the option to request the following Twitch-specific capabilities:
Capability
Description
twitch.tv/commands
Lets your bot send
PRIVMSG
messages that include /me, and receive
Twitch-specific IRC messages
.
twitch.tv/membership
Lets your bot receive
JOIN
and
PART
messages when users join and leave the chat room.
twitch.tv/tags
Adds additional metadata to the command and membership messages. For the list of metadata available with each message, see Twitch tags. To request the tags capability, you must also request the commands capability.
To request Twitch-specific command messages like
GLOBALUSERSTATE
,
ROOMSTATE
, and
USERSTATE
, send
CAP REQ:
followed by all of the capabilities listed above that you wish to include:
CAP REQ :twitch.tv/membership twitch.tv/tags twitch.tv/commands
While the above example contains all 3, you can choose one or more of the capabilities when requesting.
If your capabilities request succeeds, Twitch replies with the standard ACK subcommand message:
:tmi.twitch.tv CAP * ACK :twitch.tv/membership twitch.tv/tags twitch.tv/commands
If your bot requests a capability that the Twitch IRC server doesn’t support, the server replies with the standard NAK subcommand message that identifies the capabilities that were denied:
CAP * NAK :twitch.tv/foo
Authenticating with the Twitch IRC server
Before you can continue, you must authenticate with Twitch and get a User Access Token with
chat:read
(to read chat messages over IRC) and
chat:edit
(to send chat messages over IRC) scopes. You will need this token to continue, and also the username of the account you generated the token for.
For more information on this, see
Authenticating
.
In your IRC connection, send a PASS message containing a text string with the access token. The string’s format is
oauth:
where token is the access token. For example:
PASS oauth:yfvzjqb705z12hrhy1zkwa9xt7v662
Then send a NICK message containing a text string to your bot’s nickname. The nickname should be the lowercase login name of the Twitch account used to get your access token. For example:
NICK twitchdev
If the Twitch IRC server successfully authenticates your bot, it replies with the following numeric messages:
:tmi.twitch.tv 001 <user> :Welcome, GLHF!
:tmi.twitch.tv 002 <user> :Your host is tmi.twitch.tv
:tmi.twitch.tv 003 <user> :This server is rather new
:tmi.twitch.tv 004 <user> :-
:tmi.twitch.tv 375 <user> :-
:tmi.twitch.tv 372 <user> :You are in a maze of twisty passages.
:tmi.twitch.tv 376 <user> :>
@badge-info=;badges=;color=;display-name=<user>;emote-sets=0,300374282;user-id=12345678;user-type= :tmi.twitch.tv GLOBALUSERSTATE
The above reply was formatted for readability, but the message is actually a single string that contains multiple messages. Each message is delimited by CRLF (\r\n). For example:
:tmi.twitch.tv 001 <user> :Welcome, GLHF!\r\n:tmi.twitch.tv 002 <user> :Your host is tmi.twitch.tv\r\n:tmi.twitch.tv 003 <user> :This server is rather new\r\n:tmi.twitch.tv 004 <user> :-\r\n:tmi.twitch.tv 375 <user> :-\r\n:tmi.twitch.tv 372 <user> :You are in a maze of twisty passages, all alike.\r\n:tmi.twitch.tv 376 <user> :>\r\n@badge-info=;badges=;color=;display-name=<user>;emote-sets=0,300374282;user-id=12345678;user-type= :tmi.twitch.tv GLOBALUSERSTATE\r\n
If the server fails to authenticate your bot, it replies with the following message and closes the connection.
:tmi.twitch.tv NOTICE * :Login authentication failed
Also, as stated above, if you don’t send the PASS and NICK messages in the correct order, the authentication fails and the server replies with:
:tmi.twitch.tv NOTICE * :Improperly formatted auth
Parsing messages
So far, we’ve showed messages in multiple formats, so it should be clarified on how these messages are to appear when sent to you. When the Twitch IRC server sends a message, it may contain a single message or multiple messages. The following example shows what the message looks like if it contains a single message:
:foo!foo@foo.tmi.twitch.tv JOIN #bar\r\n
And here’s what the message looks like if it contains multiple messages. In this case, the message contains the
JOIN
,
353
,
366
,
USERSTATE
,
ROOMSTATE
, and
PART
messages. The messages are delimited by CRLF (\r\n).
:foo!foo@foo.tmi.twitch.tv JOIN #bar\r\n:foo.tmi.twitch.tv 353 foo = #bar :foo\r\n
:foo.tmi.twitch.tv 366 foo #bar :End of /NAMES list\r\n@badge-info=;badges=moderator/1;color=;display-name=foo;emote-sets=0,300374282;mod=1;subscriber=0;user-type=mod :tmi.twitch.tv USERSTATE #bar\r\n@emote-only=0;followers-only=-1;r9k=0;room-id=12345678;slow=0;subs-only=0 :tmi.twitch.tv ROOMSTATE #bar\r\n:foo!foo@foo.tmi.twitch.tv PART #bar\r\n
The Twitch IRC server does not guarantee the order of the messages. It may also send a message multiple times if it doesn’t think the chatbot received it.
Keepalive Messages
After connecting to the Twitch IRC server, even before joining a chatroom, the server sends PING messages to ensure that your chatbot is still alive and able to respond to the server’s messages. The message received by your bot will be the following:
PING :tmi.twitch.tv
After receiving a PING message, your chatbot must reply with a PONG message. The text of the PONG message must be the text from the PING message.
PONG :tmi.twitch.tv
If the bot fails to reply with a PONG, the server terminates the connection.
Joining and Leaving Chatrooms
Now that your bot has successfully authenticated with the Twitch IRC server, the next step is to join a chat room and begin sending and receiving messages.
To join chat channels, use the JOIN message. You can specify a single channel, or join multiple channels using a command delimiter:
JOIN #<channel>,#<channel>
If the bot successfully joins the channel, the server replies with the
JOIN
,
353
, and
366
messages. The text portion of the
353
message lists the users in the channel at the time you joined. The following example shows the reply message when the bar bot joined the
#twitchdev
and
#foo
channels:
:bar!bar@bar.tmi.twitch.tv JOIN #twitchdev
:bar.tmi.twitch.tv 353 bar = #twitchdev :bar
:bar.tmi.twitch.tv 366 bar #twitchdev :End of /NAMES list
:bar!bar@bar.tmi.twitch.tv JOIN #foo
:bar.tmi.twitch.tv 353 bar = #foo :bar
:bar.tmi.twitch.tv 366 bar #foo :End of /NAMES list
If the channel already has users joined to it, the reply may contain two
353
messages. The first shows the existing users in the chat room and the second shows the bot that joined.
:bar!bar@bar.tmi.twitch.tv JOIN #twitchdev
:bar.tmi.twitch.tv 353 bar = #twitchdev :xhipgamer blushyface mauerbac_bot moobot...
:bar.tmi.twitch.tv 353 bar = #twitchdev :bar
:bar.tmi.twitch.tv 366 bar #twitchdev :End of /NAMES list
If your bot requests the commands capability, the server’s reply also includes the USERSTATE and ROOMSTATE messages.
:bar!bar@bar.tmi.twitch.tv JOIN #twitchdev
:bar.tmi.twitch.tv 353 bar = #twitchdev :bar
:bar.tmi.twitch.tv 366 bar #twitchdev :End of /NAMES list
@badge-info=;badges=;color=;display-name=bar;emote-sets=0,300374282;mod=0;subscriber=0;user-type= :tmi.twitch.tv USERSTATE #twitchdev
@emote-only=0;followers-only=-1;r9k=0;room-id=141981764;slow=0;subs-only=0 :tmi.twitch.tv ROOMSTATE #twitchdev
:bar!bar@bar.tmi.twitch.tv JOIN #foo
:bar.tmi.twitch.tv 353 bar = #foo :bar
:bar.tmi.twitch.tv 366 bar #foo :End of /NAMES list
@badge-info=;badges=moderator/1;color=;display-name=bar;emote-sets=0,300374282;mod=1;subscriber=0;user-type=mod :tmi.twitch.tv USERSTATE #foo
@emote-only=0;followers-only=-1;r9k=0;room-id=713936733;slow=0;subs-only=0 :tmi.twitch.tv ROOMSTATE #foo
If you try to join a suspended or deleted channel, the bot receives a
NOTICE
message with the appropriate text. If your bot requests the tags capability, the message’s
msg-id
tag is set to
msg_channel_suspended
. If you try to join a nonexistent channel, Twitch quietly drops your
JOIN
message.
Leaving a chatroom
To leave a chatroom, use the
PART
message. Similar to
JOIN
, you can specify a single channel, or leave multiple channels using a command delimiter:
PART #<channel>,#<channel>
Sending Messages
To send a chat message to a channel’s chat room, use a PRIVMSG message:
PRIVMSG #<channel name> :This is a sample message
Your chat messages can also include emoticons. To include emoticons, use the name of the emote. The names are case sensitive. Don’t include colons around the name (e.g., :bleedPurple:). If Twitch recognizes the name, Twitch converts the name to the emote before writing the chat message to the chat room. For examples of emoticons, see
Emotes
.
PRIVMSG #<channel name> :HeyGuys <3 PartyTime
NOTE:
If you send too many messages in rapid succession, The Twitch’s chat server will silently drop your messages and may even close the IRC connection. For more information on these limits, see
Rate Limits
.
Replying to a chat message
If your bot wants to
reply to a chat message
, it needs to get the chat message’s ID. This means your chatbot must first request the tags capability. With tags enabled, the
PRIVMSG
message that the Twitch IRC server sends your bot will include the
id
tag, which identifies the chat message:
@badge-info=;badges=broadcaster/1;client-nonce=459e3142897c7a22b7d275178f2259e0;color=#0000FF;display-name=lovingt3s;emote-only=1;emotes=62835:0-10;first-msg=0;flags=;id=885196de-cb67-427a-baa8-82f9b0fcd05f;mod=0;room-id=713936733;subscriber=0;tmi-sent-ts=1643904084794;turbo=0;user-id=713936733;user-type= :lovingt3s!lovingt3s@lovingt3s.tmi.twitch.tv PRIVMSG #lovingt3s :bleedPurple
To reply to the above chat message, your bot sends the following
PRIVMSG
message and includes the
reply-parent-msg-id
tag, which identifies the chat message you’re replying to.
@reply-parent-msg-id=885196de-cb67-427a-baa8-82f9b0fcd05f PRIVMSG #lovingt3s :absolutely!
And this is what the reply looks like in the chat room:
IRC Commands
Currently, the only supported command over IRC is
/me
. It is used by inserting the command directly into your IRC message payload:
PRIVMSG #twitchdev :/me teleports behind you
This appears in chat formatted slightly different than a normal chat message:
Phone verification
If you receive the following IRC Notice message after sending a chat message, you must enable phone verification for your chatbot:
A verified phone number is required to chat in this channel. Please visit https://www.twitch.tv/settings/security to verify your phone number.
To enable phone verification, go to the chatbot’s
Security and Privacy
settings. Under
Contact
, click
Add a number
(next to
Phone Number
) and add a phone number that Twitch can verify.
If you requested tags capabilities, the
msg_id
tag is set to
msg_requires_verified_phone_number
. You should compare message IDs instead of comparing message strings, which may change in the future.
Receiving Messages
When a user enters a message in the channel’s chat room, the Twitch IRC server sends your bot a
PRIVMSG
message:
:foo!foo@foo.tmi.twitch.tv PRIVMSG #bar :bleedPurple
In the above message, the first part of the message identifies who wrote the message in the chat room. In this case, foo wrote the message.
The second part of the message identifies the type of message (command) and the name of the channel (chat room). In this case, the command is
PRIVMSG
and the message came from the bar channel’s chat room.
The third part of the message is the chat message that the user posted in the chat room. In this case, the message text contains the bleedPurple emote.
Note that your chatbot’s connection will not receive
PRIVMSG
messages for chat messages that it writes to the chat room. Instead, it receives a
USERSTATE
message, but only if you request the tags and commands capabilities. The
display-name
tag contains the bot’s name. The message does not include the chat message the bot sent.
@badge-info=;badges=moderator/1;color=#FF4500;display-name=mybot;emote-sets=0,300374282;mod=1;subscriber=0;user-type=mod :tmi.twitch.tv USERSTATE #bar
If your bot requested the tags capability, the following example shows what the PRIVMSG message looks like when it includes tags:
@badge-info=;badges=broadcaster/1;client-nonce=28e05b1c83f1e916ca1710c44b014515;color=#0000FF;display-name=foofoo;emotes=62835:0-10;first-msg=0;flags=;id=f80a19d6-e35a-4273-82d0-cd87f614e767;mod=0;room-id=713936733;subscriber=0;tmi-sent-ts=1642696567751;turbo=0;user-id=713936733;user-type= :foofoo!foofoo@foofoo.tmi.twitch.tv PRIVMSG #bar :bleedPurple
For more information about what tags can be sent by the server, and how to parse them, see
IRC Tag Reference
.
Shared Chat
Shared Chat is a feature of Twitch Chat that allows multiple channels to communicate as if they were combined. When activated, messages sent from one channel will duplicate into other channels.
When shared chat is enabled, PRIVMSG and USERNOTICE IRC commands sent to the “source” channel (the channel in which the message originates from) will be duplicated into all other channels that are combined. Each of these messages will have their own unique Message ID, specified by the
id
tag. The original tag, sent to the source channel, will be preserved across all combined channels using the
source-id
tag. Additional tags are added to serve a similar purpose, duplicating other tags including
badges
and
room-id
. All of these tags are specified in the respective command’s
IRC Tag Reference
documentation below.
As an example, while the channels Twitch and TwitchRivals are combined using Shared Chat, a message sent in the channel Twitch will first appear in the channel Twitch:
@badge-info=;badges=staff/1,twitchcon-2024---san-diego/1;client-nonce=99a343c9cf2fcf4e96e0abc358f7b59b;color=#FF4500;display-name=TwitchDev;emotes=;first-msg=1;flags=;id=4dcec0e7-7f79-4a82-8aed-91aac9d0640c;mod=0;returning-chatter=0;room-id=12826;source-badge-info=;source-badges=staff/1,twitchcon-2024---san-diego/1;source-id=4dcec0e7-7f79-4a82-8aed-91aac9d0640c;source-room-id=12826;subscriber=0;tmi-sent-ts=1725918561648;turbo=0;user-id=141981764;user-type=staff :twitchdev!twitchdev@twitchdev.tmi.twitch.tv PRIVMSG #twitch:Howdy!
Note that the badges
source-id
,
source-room-id
,
source-badges
,
source-badge-info
all appear with values. This indicates that the room is in Shared Chat mode, and the
source-room-id
here matches the
room-id
value, indicating that this is the original room in which the message was sent from.
In addition, the message will also be sent to the TwitchRivals channel:
@badge-info=;badges=staff/1,twitchcon-2024---san-diego/1;client-nonce=99a343c9cf2fcf4e96e0abc358f7b59b;color=#FF4500;display-name=TwitchDev;emotes=;flags=;id=17152d83-1fc8-4869-9d44-5157ee212ff1;mod=0;room-id=197886470;source-badge-info=;source-badges=staff/1,twitchcon-2024---san-diego/1;source-id=4dcec0e7-7f79-4a82-8aed-91aac9d0640c;source-room-id=12826;subscriber=0;tmi-sent-ts=1725918561648;turbo=0;user-id=141981764;user-type=staff :twitchdev!twitchdev@twitchdev.tmi.twitch.tv PRIVMSG #twitchrivals:Howdy!
Here we can see the same tags as before, but with modified details in the aforementioned tags. The
source-room-id
indicates that the messages was sent to the Twitch channel, but is being duplicated into the TwitchRivals channel, indicated by the
room-id
matching the TwitchRivals account. In addition, the channel tag,
#twitchrivals
, differs from the
#twitch
channel tag from earlier, as the channel tag refers to the room in which the current
message-id
is being sent to.
IRC Command Reference
The Twitch IRC server sends your bot the following commands only if your bot requests the commands capability. For information about requesting the commands capability, see
Requesting Twitch-specific capabilities
. Because the messages for these commands include minimum information, you should also request the tags capability to get a richer set of information.

Parameter
Description
channel
The name of the channel that the bot joined or sent a PRIVMSG in.
Example
:tmi.twitch.tv USERSTATE #dallas
Adding tags to the USERSTATE message
As you can see from the example, the

USERSTATE
message can include, see
Twitch IRC tags
.
The following example shows a
USERSTATE
message with tags after ronni joins the dallas channel.

IRC Tag Reference
Most IRC messages provide enough information that you can figure out what happened. For example, in the following PRIVMSG message, you know that user abc posted
HeyGuys
in the xyz channel.
:abc!abc@abc.tmi.twitch.tv PRIVMSG #xyz :HeyGuys
But what if you wanted to know more about the user? For example, are they a subscriber or what kind of badges do they have? Well, you’re in luck. Twitch provides rich information about the user if you request the tags capability (see
Requesting Twitch-specific capabilities
).
@badge-info=;badges=broadcaster/1;client-nonce=997dcf443c31e258c1d32a8da47b6936;color=#0000FF;display-name=abc;emotes=;first-msg=0;flags=0-6:S.7;id=eb24e920-8065-492a-8aea-266a00fc5126;mod=0;room-id=713936733;subscriber=0;tmi-sent-ts=1642786203573;turbo=0;user-id=713936733;user-type= :abc!abc@abc.tmi.twitch.tv PRIVMSG #xyz :HeyGuys
The Twitch IRC server follows the
IRCv3 Message Tag specification
for including tags in messages. Tags are optional metadata that Twitch attaches to an IRC message. Tags are key/value pairs (key=value). The key’s value is optional (key=). Tags may appear in any order. You should only parse tags you recognize and ignore the others.
Tags are in the form:
@tag-name-1=<tag-value-1>;tag-name-2=<tag-value-2>;....
The following are the commands that may include tags. If a tag is not documented here, it is not supported for third-party developer use.
